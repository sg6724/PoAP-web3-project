# 🎟️ Decentralized Proof of Attendance Badge (POAP) on Aptos

## 📖 Description
This project implements a decentralized **Proof of Attendance Badge (POAP)** system using the Aptos blockchain and the Move language.  
A POAP is a **digital badge (NFT)** that attendees can claim as verifiable proof of participating in an event.  
Unlike traditional certificates, these badges are stored **on-chain**, making them **tamper-proof, portable, and easily verifiable**.

The system allows:
- Event organizers to create events on-chain.
- Participants to mint unique attendance badges during the event.
- Communities to reward or recognize users based on their attendance history.

---

## 🌍 Vision
The vision of this project is to **redefine event participation in the Web3 era** by providing:
- A secure, decentralized way to record attendance.
- An engaging experience for participants through collectible badges.
- A transparent reputation layer for communities, hackathons, workshops, and meetups.

Imagine a future where your **on-chain attendance history** acts as a **resume of community involvement** — from hackathons to concerts.

## 🔮 Future Scope
This is just the beginning! Potential improvements include:
1. **Frontend dApp**  
   - User-friendly interface for event creation and badge claiming.
   - Wallet integrations (Petra, Martian, etc.).

2. **Advanced Badge Features**  
   - Customizable badge art per event.
   - Tiered badges (e.g., VIP, speaker, attendee).

3. **Gamification & Rewards**  
   - Leaderboards for frequent attendees.
   - Redeemable perks for badge holders (discounts, whitelist access, governance voting).

4. **Cross-Chain Expansion**  
   - Deploy on multiple blockchains for interoperability.
